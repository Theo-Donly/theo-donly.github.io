	The Council of Meduseld tracks the games of public sanctioned events as well as player-submitted games.  Submitted games may be any deemed to sufficiently follow ICE play rules, as determined by the CoM.  (DC games are not tracked at this time.)  CoM offers a Participation Score, a Participation Penalty Fraction, and a League Ranking.  All contributions decay over time, and players are encouraged to contribute 3 games a year to stay ranked.<br>
	<br>
	<b>To submit a game outside of a sanctioned event:</b> Both players should message Council of Meduseld#7997 via Discord prior to the start of the game, including who their opponent is and a summary of the game format.  Upon completion, both players should then submit the game results to Council of Meduseld#7997.<br>
	<br>
	Participation contributions are larger for playing games in larger events.  Penalties may be applied for dropping a game or an event.<br>
	<br>
	League ranks attempt to separate performance from participation, and are based on a generalization of SpringRank using Tournament Points for games actually played---missed matches don't count.  Ranks are thus in the context of the distribution of formats played, which likely differs for each player, and so should be taken lightly!  This is particularly true for players getting terrible sealed collections.  Players with few games are noted; their ranks are especially unconstrained.  Precise ranks are not distributed for the low 1/4 of ranked players.

	<h1>Musings</h1>
	<h3>Rules Precedence</h3>
	CoM suggests a conservative approach to rules, where rulings more distant from ICE are given lower precedence, in the sense that they are only considered when there is ambiguity from higher precedent sources.
	<ul>
	  <li>Event-specific rules (typically including CoL Tournament Rules v3).
	  <li>ICE NetRep errata from the official CRF 15 (unofficial versions were widely propagated).
	  <li>ICE rulebooks and published clarifications, from last to first.  The Rules Summary from MEBA is neither rulebook nor rules clarification, as it is considered to be necessary to simplify material for a complete rules summary.
	  <li>ICE NetRep rulings, from last to first.
	  <li>CoE Rulings, from last to first.
	</ul>

	<h3>Scoring</h3>
	CoM currently suggests the trial of the following Tournament Point system in place of the the Council of Lorien system.  This system is roughly 1.5x TP of the CoL, and is designed to slightly elevate the importance of winning over the CoL MP gaps, as well as reduce Swiss pairing skill variance from early concessions and One Ring losses.
	<ul>
	  <li>A One Ring win is 10 TP.
	  <li>A Marshalling Point win more than 2x+10 over opponent is 9 TP.
	  <li>Otherwise, more than 1.5x+5 over opponent is 8 TP.
	  <li>Otherwise, more than 1.2x+2 over opponent is 7 TP.
	  <li>Otherwise, over opponent is 6 TP.
	  <li>A tie is 4.5 TP.
	  <li>An MP loss is 9 minus opponent's TP.  (This is equivalent to 3 minus 1 for each complete gap of (opponent's MP + 10)/6 from opponent.)
	  <li>A loss to One Ring is as though opponent had twice the MP needed to call. (For 2-deck games, this means 20 MP gives 1 TP, 30 MP gives 2 TP, 40 MP gives 3 TP.)
	  <li>Concession is 0 TP to the one conceding and max TP to opponent according to their deck capability (9 or 10).  Conceeding early during an event will also incure a participation penalty and the player may be dropped from the event.  Event participants are strongly encouraged to contact the event coordinator prior to round pairings when an absence is foreseeable.
	  <li>A bye from an incomplete pairing is worth 9 TP for the first round and 1.5 less TP for each round thereafter, to a minimum of 4.5.  When possible, tournament organizers should strive to have a standby player to make even pairings for the first round.
	  <li>Point modification from early concessions and byes are awarded incrementally at the start of remaining tournament rounds for pairing purposes.  (E.g. consider a 4-round event.  A round 1 early concession at 15-20 MP will cause the conseeder to be paired in round 2 as if the game contributed 2 TP, in round 3 as if that game contributed only 1 TP, and in round 4 with that game contributing 0 TP.  A bye from an incomplete pairing awards 4.5 points immediately, and another 1.5 points prior to each remaining round.)

	<h1>The Tenets of the Council of Meduseld</h1>
	<ul>
	  <li>We believe groups of players should play how they want.
	  <li>We organize and assist with events as prime opportunities for players to engage in larger communities for collaborative enjoyment.
	  <li>We expect that prior to an event, event coordinators will determine and communicate how rules disputes will be adjudicated, to the extent feasible.  We expect informed players to decline events that will likely disallow them from playing how they want.
	  <li>We value the legitimacy of the rules texts and cards of ICE, the game's designers, in all of their complexity.
	</ul>

	<h2>History</h2>
	The Middle Earth Collectable Card Game was created by Iron Crown Enterprises (ICE) between 1995 and 1998, at which point they lost their license to sell Middle Earth products.  ICE had been publishing role-playing game manuals for several decades, and perhaps as a consequence the CCG they made offers richer game storytelling and strategy---at the cost of rule complexity---than essentially every other CCG I've seen.  The community has persisted through the years, likely because of these achievements.<br>
	<br>
	With the release of the free, browser-based play platform <b>cardnum</b> in August 2018, the community realized a new potential for diverse participation.  This presented new opportunities to overcome the age-old mindsets for organizing events and handling rules disputes.  The first cardnum tournament was held two years later at the same time that the Coronavirus pandemic pushed more play online.  Council of Meduseld was long pondered by prominant community member Theo, and officially announced in 2023 to help organize community events.  CoM is not meant to be the best fit for everyone, but a more anocratic alternative to CoE, empowering individual organizers to handle their own affairs with feedback from other organizers.<br>
	<br>
	I, Theo, am many things, but one thing that I am not is a very practiced website developer.  If you would like to offer suggestions or code, I am as growth-minded as my time allows.
