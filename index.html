	      Here I'm attempting to organize some of my modern contributions to online communities.
	      <ul>
		<li><b>Middle Earth Collectable Card Game:</b> I organize the independent player community <a href="MECCG/">Council of Meduseld</a>, along with online events, rules discussions, and player performance tracking.
		<li><b>Minecraft:</b> I researched compact cactus farming to improve state of the art (over SciCraft) by 40%, used for XP banks.  <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/@theonis_minecraft">My YouTube videos.</a>
		<li><b>Dungeons & Dragons / Pathfinder:</b> I developed menu-based approaches to ability score generation that aim for the fairness of the point buy system along with the correlations within a character's <i>set</i> of ability scores from standard rolling. (link in progress)
		<li><b>Stardew Valley:</b> I wrote a dynamic program in Python for optimum crop rotations based on seasonal purchase and growth constraints.  I haven't made it public-friendly, so chat with me if you're curious.
	      </ul>
	      Older stuff (much of which was once hosted on platforms that have ceased to exist)
	      <ul>
		<li><b>Descent, Journeys in the Dark 2E:</b> I made a dynamic program in Python for comparing the outcome distributions of acquireable actions based on types of dice rolled and special abilities.
		<li><b>World of Warcraft:</b> Into Cataclysm, I made extensive Moonkin damage estimators for optimizing skill sequences and prioritizing gear attributes.  Top guild dps (and healing)!
		<li><b>Diablo 2:</b> Here's a link to my <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="D2/runewordscalc.html">rune word calculator</a> page.  I also have a number of the mechanic formulas archived; let me know if you are in need.
		<li><b>RoboWar:</b> I used to co-lead the community.  I have lots of historic stuff that I'll pull out of archives at some point.  This game got me into coding and algorithms before I knew what either of those were.
		<li><b>Ambrosia Macintosh Games:</b> I've ported a key generator to Python for their early games.  I also wrote a dynamic program to prove optimum Escape Velocity 3 (Nova) trade circuits based on the connectivity graph and trade options of planets.  Once upon a time, I was one of the core contributors to the first group-made stories in the Cythera forums.
